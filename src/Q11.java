//In this code, the printMe method of the Maryland class will output "Read it." The other printMe calls will output:
//
//        "Ship it." (from State class)
//        "Box it." (from Region class)
//        "Buy it." (from Place class)
//        "Read it." (from Maryland class)
//        "Buy it." (from Place class)
//        "Buy it." (from Place class)
//        This is because the printMe method in each class overrides the printMe method in its superclass, so when a subclass object calls the printMe method, it will execute the overridden version of the method.

//        It is important to note that while the shallow inheritance tree may have seemed like a convenient solution at first, it can lead to various problems and complications in the long run. A deep inheritance tree, on the other hand, promotes better code organization, modularity, and flexibility.
